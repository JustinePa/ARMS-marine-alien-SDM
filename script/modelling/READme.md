# Species Distribution Modeling Scripts

This repository contains R scripts and SLURM job submission files for running species distribution models using the biomod2 framework. 
These scripts were used to model 69 marine invasive species across European waters for "The role of genetic observatory networks in the detection and forecasting of marine non-indigenous species" ([preprint](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-8702791/v1)).

## Overview

The modeling pipeline consists of four main steps:
01. **Individual modeling** - Train multiple algorithms for each species
02. **Ensemble modeling** - Create ensemble models from individual models
03. **Current projections** - Project ensemble models to current conditions
04. **Future projections** - Project to future climate scenarios (SSP 1-2.6, 2-4.5, 5-8.5)

All steps are designed for parallel execution on HPC clusters using SLURM job arrays.

## Scripts

## Step 1: Individual Species Modeling
This step fits species distribution models for each species independently and saves model evaluation metrics. It is the most computationally intensive step and is designed to run as a SLURM job array on an HPC cluster.
- **01_modeling_mixedPA.R** - Main modeling script with mixed pseudo-absence strategy
- **01_modeling_mixedPA_array.slurm** - SLURM array job for parallel processing

**Algorithms:** Random Forest (RF), MAXNET, MARS, GAM, XGBoost (more can be chosen, see BIOMOD2 documentation  
**Cross-validation:** 5-fold CV  
**Pseudo-absences:** Mixed strategy (disk + random), 20-100 km from presences for the disk method

### Prerequisites

Before running this step, make sure you have:

- [ ] R 4.4.1 with the following packages installed: `biomod2`, `terra`, `dplyr`
- [ ] A working SLURM environment (see note below on cluster compatibility)
- [ ] The environmental raster `myExpl_shelf.tif` in your working directory
      (generated by `pre-modelling/environmental data/` scripts 01–08)
- [ ] Thinned occurrence files for each species in `occurrences_thinned_0825/`,
      named `{SpeciesName}_merged_thinned_2025-08-19.csv`
      (generated by `pre-modelling/occurrence data/` scripts 01–04)
- [ ] `species_list.txt` in your working directory, one species per line

### Setup

Open `01_modeling_mixedPA_array.slurm` and edit the following fields:
```bash
#SBATCH -A                    # your project/allocation ID
#SBATCH --array=1-69          # adjust to match the number of lines in species_list.txt
MODELING_DATE="2025-09-24"    # keep this date for the published analysis,
                              # or set today's date if re-running from scratch
export R_LIBS_USER=           # path to your R library
cd                            # path to your working directory
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** `MODELING_DATE` is used to build the `modeling_id` string
> that links outputs across scripts 01–04. If you change it here, you must
> use the same value in `02_ensemble_array.slurm`, `03_projection_EM.slurm`,
> and `04_projection_future_EM_array.slurm`.

> ⚠️ **Cluster compatibility:** The module load commands are specific to the
> Dardel cluster at PDC (KTH, Sweden). Replace them with the equivalent
> modules available on your system, ensuring R 4.4.1, GDAL, PROJ, and GEOS
> are loaded.

### Run
```bash
sbatch 01_modeling_mixedPA_array.slurm
```

Each array task processes one species. Logs are written to
`logs/{SpeciesName}/{SpeciesName}_{JobID}_{TaskID}.out/.err`.

### Outputs

For each species, the following file is written to `eval/`:
```
eval/{SpeciesName}_mixed_myExpl_shelf_kfold/
└── eval_{SpeciesName}_2025-09-24_mix50_kfold_myExpl_shelf.csv
```

This CSV contains TSS, ROC, and other evaluation metrics for each
algorithm × CV fold combination. These are used in Figure 1 and as
input to Step 2 (ensemble modelling).

### Key modelling choices

| Parameter | Value | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Algorithms | RF, MAXNET, MARS, GAM, XGBoost | Diverse algorithmic families for ensemble robustness |
| Cross-validation | 5-fold | Balance between computational cost and evaluation reliability |
| Pseudo-absence strategy | Mixed disk + random (50/50) | Reduces spatial bias while maintaining background representation |
| PA distance | 20–100 km from presences | Avoids false absences in areas likely occupied |
| PA count | 3× presences (max 500 for n < 100) | Scales with data availability |

### Troubleshooting

- **Species not found:** Check that the species name in `species_list.txt`
  matches the filename in `occurrences_thinned_0825/` exactly.
- **Fewer than 10 presences:** The script will exit cleanly with an error
  message. These species are excluded from downstream analysis.
- **Job times out:** Increase `--time` in the SLURM script. Runtime scales
  with occurrence count and available cores.


## Step 2: Ensemble modelling

Scripts: `02_ensemble.R`, `02_ensemble_array.slurm`

This step combines the individual algorithm outputs from Step 1 into ensemble
models for each species, and saves ensemble evaluation metrics. It must be run
after Step 1 has completed successfully for all species.

### Prerequisites

- [ ] Step 1 completed — individual model `.out` files must exist for all species
- [ ] `species_list_ensemble.txt` in your working directory — this list contains
      only species that successfully produced individual models in Step 1
      (i.e. species that passed the 10-presence threshold and did not time out).
      It may be shorter than `species_list.txt`.
- [ ] R 4.4.1 with the following packages installed: `biomod2`, `terra`, `dplyr`

### Setup

Open `02_ensemble_array.slurm` and edit the following fields:
```bash
#SBATCH -A                     # your project/allocation ID
#SBATCH --array=1-69           # adjust to match the number of lines
                               # in species_list_ensemble.txt (may differ from step 1)
MODELING_DATE="2025-09-24"     # ⚠️ must exactly match the value used in step 1
export R_LIBS_USER=            # path to your R library
cd                             # path to your working directory
```

> ⚠️ **Critical: `MODELING_ID` must match Step 1 exactly.**
> The `MODELING_ID` is constructed from `MODELING_DATE`, the CV strategy, and
> the environment file name — the same components used in Step 1 to name model
> output files. If there is any mismatch, the R script will fail to locate the
> model files and exit with "Model file not found". If you kept the published
> value (`2025-09-24`) in Step 1, keep it here too.

### Run
```bash
sbatch 02_ensemble_array.slurm
```

Each array task processes one species. Logs are written to
`1.logs/EM/ensemble_{SpeciesName}_{ModelingID}.out/.err`.

### Outputs

For each species, ensemble model objects are saved to the species directory,
and evaluation metrics are written to `EM_mix50/`:
```
EM_mix50/
└── full_eval_EM_{SpeciesName}_{ModelingID}.csv
```

Each CSV contains TSS and ROC evaluation scores for the three ensemble methods
produced at this step: weighted mean (EMwmean), coefficient of variation (EMcv),
and committee averaging (EMca). Only individual models passing the selection
thresholds (TSS ≥ 0.6, ROC-AUC ≥ 0.85) are included in the ensemble.

### Key modelling choices

| Parameter | Value | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Ensemble methods | EMwmean, EMcv, EMca | Suitability, uncertainty, and model agreement |
| Model selection | TSS ≥ 0.6, ROC ≥ 0.85 | Retains only well-performing individual models |
| Weighting | Proportional to TSS | Higher-performing models contribute more |

### Troubleshooting

- **"Model file not found":** The `MODELING_ID` in this script does not match
  what was used in Step 1. Check that `MODELING_DATE`, CV strategy, and
  environment file name are identical across both scripts.
- **Array index out of range:** The number of species in
  `species_list_ensemble.txt` is smaller than `--array=1-N`. Set `N` to
  `wc -l < species_list_ensemble.txt`.
- **Species skipped in Step 1:** If a species timed out or failed in Step 1,
  remove it from `species_list_ensemble.txt` before running this step.
